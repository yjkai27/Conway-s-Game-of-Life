Game of Life, created by John Horton Conway, is a cellular automation with two dimensional grid with cells either being populated or unpopulated. The game is not a traditional game with players and strategies, but instead a simulation. The rules of the game dictate how the cells evolve over time based in their current state and the states of their neighbor. The evolution of the cells occurs in discrete generations. 

The rules of the Game of Life are simple but can lead to complex and interesting patterns. They are as follows:

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
